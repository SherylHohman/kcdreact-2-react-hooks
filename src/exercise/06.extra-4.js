		BUT, once an ErrorBoundary UI has been output, that UI node will be persistent.
		The app cannot fully recover from the error. Sure, it does not crash, BUT
		the ErrorBoundary portion of the UI cannot ever be replaced.
		EG, once an invalid pokemon name has been entered, the ErrorBoundary UI
			states as such. But when a valid pokemon is SUBSEQUENTLY entered, the
			pokemon card still shows the old "invalid pokemon" name message, and cannot
			even fetch the new pokemon. Even though the input box and pokemonName is
			updated, the ErrorBoundary continues to hijack the entire PokemonInfo
			component, so a new fetch does not happen, and the ErrorBoundary UI still
			shows the error message based on the old, bad pokemonName.

	THIS WILL BE ADDRESSED IN THE NEXT EXTRA CREDIT

  //	React looks for any component that has a function called:
  //				** NOTE it may look only for the FIRST component above it... I
  //						think once a (Error Boundary) component intercepts the Error
  //						object, it handles the errant UI, and does NOT continue to pass
  //						the Error up the tree. Of course, should the Error Boundary
  //						*also* produce an Error (throw an Error), then THAT error
  //						*would* propogate up looking for an ErrorBoundary component
  //						above *it* to handle that new Error. So, I have some misnomers
  //						in some of the text in this file!!
  //						(propogate might also be an incorrect term.)
  //						This note may also be incorrect. Maybe it does continue passing
  //						the Error up the tree, but I do not think that makes sense.
  //						Esp considering that it is a React mechanism to swap out a bad
  //						UI rendering with something that the DOM can render.
  //						(and that can be useful for displaying info about a thrown error
  //						and possibly even provide an mechanism for recovering from errors.)
  //		getDerivedStateFromError(error) AND/OR componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo<optional>)
  //	If it finds one, React considers this component an Error Boundary Component.
  //		and it calls that/those method(s), passing the error (an object of type Error)
  //	Note that those two methods are called in different phases.
  //		getDerivedStateFromError(error): before the re-render
  //		componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo<optional>): after re-render
  //	(TODO: re-render is inaccurate term; update word choice above.)
  //	This occurs anytime an Error is thrown.
  //		But the error can only be intercepted/caught by an an Error Boundary (Component)
  //		if it originates in a component that is a CHILD to said Error Boundary.
  //		It [The error/search for Error Boundary Component] only traverses UP from the
  //		component that threw an Error. Errors within an Error Boundary component
  //		cannot catch its own error. But it could be caught in another Error Boundary
  //		component if one exists higher in the tree.
  //	IF no Error Boundary Component wraps the Component that threw an error,
  //		React cannot gracefully handle the error, an a "white screen of death"
  //		and the app may crash as a result, with no feedback to the user.
  //	Remember, the main function of the Error Boundary component is to replace
  //		the broken UI that React cannot display, with some fallback "error" UI.
  //		The magic that React is able to perform, when Error Boundary is defined,
  //		is that it can seamlessly "discard" (my words, maybe not accurage)
  //		un-Mount the broken UI internally, and re-Mount it with the replacement
  //		UI supplied by the EB supplied by the Error Boundary render(props)
  //		method. Thus, via this intercept mechanism, a broken UI that the DOM
  //		is incapably of displaying, is swapped out by this FallBack UI that the
  //		DOM CAN display.
  //	The major payoff means that the REST of the UI renders as normal for
  //		everything NOT wrapped by the invoked Error Boundary, and EVERYTHING
  //		INSIDE (wrapped by, all its children) are Replaced by the Error Boundary
  //		UI.
  //	NOTE: You can partially see that in action by the way we write the render
  //		function for an Error Boundary component.
  //		if (this.steate.someErrorBoundaryStateVariable===false) {render children}
  //		else {render this fallback UI}
  //		Of course we usually write it in reverse: if (error) {UI} else {children}

  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // error that is passed in here comes from outside. React intercepts any thrown
    //	Errors that occur in the component's children and automatically calls this
    //	method, supplying the error (an Error object type).
    //	It is NOT from props, which come from our Component invocation.
    //	This method does NOT get direct access to the props. ...CHECK
    //	Instead, props are used ... CHECK.

    //	it is captured whenever an error is THROWN from a wrapped component
    //	When that happens, React looks to see if a parent component of the one
    //	that threw an error has one of the these two methods on it:
    //			getDerivedStateFromError(error)
    //			componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo)
    //	if so, it sais, hey this is an "Error Boundary" component, and
    //	calls this method, passing in the thrown Error object

    //   // The getDerivedStateFromError() method is invoked if some error occurs
    //   // 	during the rendering phase of any lifecycle methods or any children
    //   //	components. This method is used to implement the Error Boundaries for
    //   // 	the React application. It is called during the render phase, so
    //   // 	side-effects are not permitted in this method.
    //   // 	For side-effects, use componentDidCatch() instead.

    //   // if use state, set it here eg:
    //   // setState({hasError: true})

    // NOTE: the return value of this method is what the state of the Error Boundary
    //		will be set to.
    //	React calls this.setState() for us, passing in our return value from this method.
    //	This component's method is simply to transform the Error object it receives
    //	into whatever format is useful for the (fallback UI) render method to use.

    //  The render phase of *this* error boundary component will not have direct
    //		access to the error variable. So it must be saved to state.
    //
    //	SO... whether or not an error occured must be stored in the ErrorBoundary's
    //		state variable,
    //			- so we know :
    //			- whether to render out the fallback error boundary UI, or to
    //			- or to render the (usual) children UI, ie when no errors were thrown
    //			- and if we want access to any info inside the (thrown) Error object
    //				so we can display it in the fallback UI, we must save that info
    //				to the state object as well. We can either save the entire Error object.
    //				or just pull specific properties from it, such as error.message.
    //				Anything regarding the `error` that we need access to in the render
    //				function must be transferred to the state object.
    //		It seems this function will generally be empty. It essentially just
    //			returns a state object, and does this instead of calling setState()
    //			explicitely. Not sure why they designed it this way. Perhaps less
    //			boiler plate? I'm sure experience will make it clear.

    //		Notice, if do not want the UI to display any info about the error,
    //			We still need to return, at a minimum, a Boolean value for state.
    //			eg: return {hasError: Boolean(error)}
    //			Then render method chooses UI based on if (this.state.hasError) / else

  /*	06.extra-4 instructions 4. ðŸ’¯ create an ErrorBoundary component

			Weâ€™ve already solved the problem for errors in our request, weâ€™re only handling
				that one error. But there are a lot of different kinds of errors that can
				happen in our applications.

			No matter how hard you try, eventually your app code just isnâ€™t going to behave
				the way you expect it to and youâ€™ll need to handle those exceptions. If an
				error is thrown and unhandled, your application will be removed from the
				page, leaving the user with a blank screenâ€¦ Kind of awkwardâ€¦

			Luckily for us, thereâ€™s a simple way to handle errors in your application using
				a special kind of component called an Error Boundary. Unfortunately, there is
				currently no way to create an Error Boundary component with a function and
				you have to use a class component instead.

			In this extra credit, read up on ErrorBoundary components
				https://reactjs.org/docs/error-boundaries.html#how-about-trycatch
				and try to create one that handles this and any other error for the
				PokemonInfo component.

			ðŸ’° to make your error boundary component handle errors from the PokemonInfo
				component, instead of rendering the error within the PokemonInfo component,
				youâ€™ll need to throw error right in the function so React can hand that to
				the error boundary. So if (status === 'rejected') throw error.
 */
  /*	06.extra-3 instructions 3. ðŸ’¯ store the state in an object

			Youâ€™ll notice that weâ€™re calling a bunch of state updaters in a row.
			This is normally not a problem, but each call to our state updater can result
			in a re-render of our component.
			React normally batches these calls so you only get a single re-render,
			but itâ€™s unable to do this in an asynchronous callback
			(like our promise success and error handlers).

			So you might notice that if you do this:

					setStatus('resolved')
					setPokemon(pokemon)

			Youâ€™ll get an error indicating that you cannot read image of null.
			This is because the setStatus call results in a re-render that happens before
			the setPokemon happens.

			In the future, youâ€™ll learn about how useReducer can solve this problem really
			elegantly, but we can still accomplish this by storing our state as an object
			that has all the properties of state weâ€™re managing.

			See if you can figure out how to store all of your state in a single object
			with a single React.useState call so I can update my state like this:

					setState({status: 'resolved', pokemon})
	*/
  /*	06.extra-2 instructions 2. ðŸ’¯ use a status

			Our logic for what to show the user when is kind of convoluted and requires that
			we be really careful about which state we set and when.

			We could make things much simpler by having some state to set the explicit
			status of our component. Our component can be in the following "states":

				idle			: no request made yet
				pending		: request started
				resolved	: request successful
				rejected	: request failed

			Try to use a status state by setting it to these string values rather than
			relying on existing state or booleans.

			Learn more about this concept here:
			https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-using-isloading-booleans

			ðŸ’° Warning: Make sure you call setPokemon before calling setStatus.
			Weâ€™ll address that more in the next extra credit.
	*/
  /*	06.extra-1 (handle fetch errors) instructions:

			Unfortunately, sometimes things go wrong and we need to handle errors when they
				do so we can show the user useful information.
				Handle that error and render it out like so:

					<div role="alert">
						There was an error: <pre style={{whiteSpace: 'normal'}}>{error.message}</pre>
					</div>

				You can make an error happen by typing an incorrect pokemon name into the input.

			One common question I get about this extra credit is how to handle promise errors.
			There are two ways to do it in this extra credit:

			// option 1: using .catch
					fetchPokemon(pokemonName)
						.then(pokemon => setPokemon(pokemon))
						.catch(error => setError(error))

			// option 2: using the second argument to .then
					fetchPokemon(pokemonName).then(
						pokemon => setPokemon(pokemon),
						error => setError(error),
					)

			These are functionally equivalent for our purposes, but they are semantically
				different in general.

			Using .catch means that youâ€™ll handle an error in the fetchPokemon promise,
				but youâ€™ll also handle an error in the setPokemon(pokemon) call as well.
				This is due to the semantics of how promises work.

			Using the second argument to .then means that you will catch an error that
				happens in fetchPokemon only. In this case, I knew that calling setPokemon
				would not throw an error (React handles errors and we have an API to catch
				those which weâ€™ll use later), so I decided to go with the second argument
				option.

			However, in this situation, it doesnâ€™t really make much of a difference.
				If you want to go with the safe option, then opt for .catch.

						which makes it fine for external logging services, while
						getDerivedStateFromError(error) is appropriate for setting state,
						(and that state is used to trigger the errorBoundary UI to render the
						error UI)

					Remember:
						- getDerivedStateFromError(error) TAKES IN THE THROWN ERROR (and
							error.message contains the MESSAGE that the error was thrown with)
						- use that passed in `error` to set some state that is also used to
							tell its component to render the error UI.
						- must update errorBoundary state like below:
								componentDidCatch(error) {
									//...do stuff in function if necessary...
										return ( {error} )
										// or maybe return {hasError: true, message: error.message}
										// depending on how want to write the render function
								}
							aka above internally does the following:
									this.setState({error})
						- If there is NO error in the wrapped components, this errorBoundary
							component MUST render its children!!:
								return {this.props.children}



			06.extra-3 COMMENTS and setState order within useEffect
				(from commit message)

				add tons of comments and console.logs
				updated minor bugs RE: logging and implications of where logs were.

				special attention paid to RE: ordering of useState and console.log output
				This has implications much beyond console.logs.
				TLDR; order matters inside asynch func.
				TBF, I should not be printing out a variable that is not included as
					a dependancy. It should only be printed OUTSIDE the useEffect function.
					(If I added it to the dependacy list, though, it would infinite-loop)

				This is a lesson as to why the dependacy array is so important!

				It also provides an interesting illustration of:
				1) setState being both asynch, but also gauranteed for useEffect
				2) Lifecycle order
				3) closures inside useEffect, combined with Lifecycle order
				5) the JS event loop, perhaps
				4) Order matters inside asynch functions. // maybe that is not in play here.
						// my comments suggest it is, but I may have been mistaken. I now think
						// those other factors may account for everything.

				Remember, I am keeping comments and console.logs because this file is
					a teaching document, and a record of my learning process.


		RE: 3. state in object

			06.extra-3 refactor: remove "null" state from obj

			In solution video, Kent "removes" the unused state properties from the
				object during setState calls, for the properties that (would be) set
				to "null"	during that update and will not be used anywhere in the app
				during that render cycle.

				eg. 	  setState({status: PENDING})
				mine 	  setState({status: PENDING, pokemon: null, error: null})

				eg.			setState({status: REJECTED, error})
				vs			setState({status: REJECTED, error, pokemon: null})
				or			setState(prev=>({...prev, status: REJECTED, error}))
				In this case the previous value of pokemon was already null before setState

				pokemon and error are not used in UI (or ANYWHERE) when status is PENDING,
								so why set it, or have those properties ("variables") even exist
								(for that render), I suppose it the logic.
								Anyway, at the time of the setState call to update the var,
								they were KNOWN to have a null value, and null works "the same"
								as undefined in MOST* cases, anyway it would for our use in this app.
								So if the app did erroneously try to access those values, the
								app and UI would respond the same as if those properties DID
								exist on the object, and were set the the value "null", rather
								than not existing on the object, and thus being "undefined".
								*(Of course this depends on if "falsey"/?? comparisons are
								being used or if === null/.? was being used -- but in that case
								there would likely be an error anyway, because the property
								would not even exist, so undefined on the left-hand side).

				eg.			setState(prev => {...prev, status: IDLE})
								// error and pokemon are (still) null

				orig		setState({status: IDLE, pokemon: null, error: null})

		RE: role="alert"
		role="alert" tells screen readers to read it right away, (alert message)
		eg: 	<div role="alert"> ...stuff to alert... </div>

    RE: Why set pokemon null before fetch
      SH: Setting pokemon to null clears previous result and
      re-renders image to show loading screen until response is received.
      If fetch fails, well, the loading screen remains
      If fetch is successful, setState updates and re-renders with new pokemon.

    RE: Wrapper

      Update:
      I guess wrapper for calling the fetchPokemon (returns Promise) is not necessary.
      I guess the fetchPokemon() call *IS* the wrapped function?
      It is the only level of wrapping that we need?
      Only need an additional layer of wrapping if using asynch await.

          React.useEffect(() => {
            async function effect() {
              const result = await doSomeAsyncThing()
              // do something with the result
            }
            effect()
          })

      For Promises, this works:

          React.useEffect(() => {
            doSomeAsyncThing().then(result => {
              // do something with the result
            })
          })

		  PREVIOUS: NOTE, I was WRONG below! (Explanation in instructions was slightly confusing to me! Dunno if it caused the same misunderstanding to others, or just to me!)
					Their solution does not use a wrapper. Why?
      I am using a wrapper because the return value for useEffect is supposed
      to be the cleanup function.
      Solution did NOT use a wrapper, and also did not use a catch
      :-((  Did I do unnecessary work. Make it too complicated?

      If not wrapped, this is what *I* think would happen:
      1) the early return sets an empty cleanup function.
        while this is what we want in this case, it is being accidentally set
        to that value for the wrong reasons. A code change could produce errors.
        The code is misleading.
      2) Hmm. Doesn't a promise always have a return value?
        I might be wrong on this, or misunderstand. But is not an implicit
        `.then()` part of this? I need to re-read promises and asynch/await
        to be sure. Anyway, if so, then that is also being set as a returned
        cleanup value in the case of a successful fetch.
        Maybe it is only asynch/await that causes this type of issue?
        Or perhaps I misunderstand altogether, and there is no issue at all.
