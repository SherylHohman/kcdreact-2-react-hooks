# useEffect: persistent state

## 📝 Your Notes

Elaborate on your learnings here in `src/exercise/02.md`

Hooks let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

### Exercise 02.js: useEffect & localStorage

#### useEffect

`useEffect` is similar to **`componentDidMount`** and **`componentDidUpdate`**
and **`componentWillUnmount`** _combined_

The `Effect` Hook lets you perform _side effects_ in function components. It
makes changes _AFTER_ component has _rendered_. Like `componentDidMount` and
`componentDidUpdate`. The effect applies to the _current_ render, and the
function passed in will re-run at the next render.

Examples of common usage:

- **Data fetching**
- setting up a subscription, and
- manually changing the DOM in React components

[useEffect docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-effect.html)

#### Read data from localStorage

`initialName = window.localStorage.getItem('name') ?? initialName`

Syntax: `var aValue = storage.getItem(keyName);`

Returns: A DOMString containing the value of the key. If the key does not exist,
null is returned.

[Storage.getItem() - MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/getItem)

#### Set data to localStorage

`window.localStorage.setItem('name', name)`

Syntax: `storage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);`

[Storage.setItem() - MDN docs]()
[MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Storage/setItem)

#### remove data from localStorage

`Storage.removeItem()` When passed a key name, will remove that key from the
storage.

`Storage.clear()` When invoked, will empty all keys out of the storage.

#### Javascript refresher

##### ?? - nullish coalescing operator (reminder)

> ?? is like || but for null or undefiend only, rather than falsey (eg 0, ''.)
> It shortcircuits for everything except null or udefined

##### ?. - optional chaining operator

> The ?. operator is like the . chaining operator, except that instead of
> causing an _error_ if a reference is _nullish_ (`null` or `undefined`), the
> expression short-circuits with a return value of `undefined`.\
> When used with function calls, it returns undefined if the given function does
> not exist.

```
let customer = {name: "Carl"};
const customerCity = customer?.city ?? "Unknown city";
// Unknown city
```

Function, Array, & Expression ?. examples:

```
obj.func?.(args)
obj.arr?.[index]
obj.val?.[expr]
obj.val?.prop

let arrayItem = arr?.[42];
  // `undefined`, OR `arr[42]`'s value
let nestedProp = obj?.['prop' + 'Name'];
  // `undefined` OR value of `arr[propName]`

function doSomething(onContent, onError) {
  try { // ... do something with the data }
  catch (err) {
    onError?.(err.message);
    // no exception if onError is undefined
  }
}
```

### Exercise 02.extra-1.js:

#### useState

useState and setState are Asynchronous useState is called again at EVERY
re-render. So, it is RECREATING the var and setVar every time. BUT at subsequent
calls, instead of setting var to the initial value, it is set to the last value
that was saved via the setVal function. The val is actually "reassigned" (it is
a new copy of a const variable) a value at every render, equal to whatever value
was set last time setVal was called.

I think mentally, I was treating it as a global variable, without realizing that
that is what I was doing. I kind of just kept the same var as before, with its
prev value. setVal is also a new function.

(BTW, window.localStorage.getItem()/setItem() is Synchronous!!, unlike data
fetching from a server via an http request.)

Pass a callback with useState if the function ............

For example, ,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

OK. Very useful:
https://kentcdodds.com/blog/use-state-lazy-initialization-and-function-updates

When call a function with arguments, if any of those arguments are expressions,
including function calls, it first determines the result of those expressions
(including executing function calls invoked.)

Then it calls the (outer/main) function (in question), sending the argument
values, including results from any expressions.

Once the function is invoked, the function decides what to do with those values.

In the case of useState, the value passed in is only used once: the first time
it is rendered -- at the time the component is mounted.

At subsequent renders, the parameter is ignored. It somehow knows it already
exists, and uses the last value stored via its last call to setWhatever (or the
initial value, if setWhatever has never been called to update the state value),
to set _the new_ instance of the Whatever variable to that stored state value.

The thing is, if the initialValue is a number, string etc, there is zero
overhead. If it is a simple function returning the same, the "oerhead" to rerun
the function is, again, incredibly small, can be ignored.

But, if the function is computationally intensive, it will cycle up some CPU,
and take time. Time for something that will just be ignored/thrown away once the
useState function gets it.

So, for computationally intensive functions, we do not want to _invoke_ the
expensive function, sending in the results of that function.

Instead, we want to send in a non-invoked function, and have useState decide
what to do with it. If First Render (just mounted), we want useState to invoke
that function to get, then set, the initial value.

If it is a re-render has no need for the parameter, so it ignores it and throws
it away as always.

So, the way we acomplish this is to send in an anonymous function that returns
the expensiveFunction that is to be used to determine/set the initialValue.

window.localStorage.getItem() is an expensive function. It needs only be called
when the component is mounted (eg on page load / page "refresh").

NO:

```
const initialValue = window.localStorage.getItem('name')
  // this literally has to re-read the Storage on every render. But then useState ignores this (expensive) value, on every re-render. (only used at first mount)
const [name, setName] = useState(initialValue)
```

YES:

```
const initialValue = ()=> window.localStorage.getItem('name')
  // this is a function definition that does not get invoked. (fast, no real overhead.) useState then invokes it when the component is mounted, but discards the anon function without invoking it on re-renders.
const [name, setName] = useState(initialValue)
```

Another way to write this is as:

NO:

```
const [name, setName] = useState(window.localStorage.getItem('name'))
```

YES:

```
const [name, setName] = useState(()=> window.localStorage.getItem('name'))
```

## Background

`React.useEffect` is a built-in hook that allows you to run some custom code
after React renders (and re-renders) your component to the DOM. It accepts a
callback function which React will call after the DOM has been updated:

```javascript
React.useEffect(() => {
  // your side-effect code here.
  // this is where you can make HTTP requests or interact with browser APIs.
})
```

### KCD Aside

Feel free to take a look at `src/examples/hook-flow.png` if you're interested in
the timing of when your functions are run. This will make more sense after
finishing the exercises/extra credit/instruction.

## Exercise

Production deploys:

- [Exercise](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/exercise/02.js)
- [Final](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.js)

In this exercise, we're going to enhance our `<Greeting />` component to get its
initial state value from localStorage (if available) and keep localStorage
updated as the `name` is updated.

## Extra Credit

### 1. 💯 lazy state initialization

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-1.js)

Right now, every time our component function is run, our function reads from
localStorage. This is problematic because it could be a performance bottleneck
(reading from localStorage can be slow). And what's more we only actually need
to know the value from localStorage the first time this component is rendered!
So the additional reads are wasted effort.

To avoid this problem, React's useState hook allows you to pass a function
instead of the actual value, and then it will only call that function to get the
state value when the component is rendered the first time. So you can go from
this: `React.useState(someExpensiveComputation())` To this:
`React.useState(() => someExpensiveComputation())`

And the `someExpensiveComputation` function will only be called when it's
needed!

Make the `React.useState` call use lazy initialization to avoid a performance
bottleneck of reading into localStorage on every render.

### 2. 💯 effect dependencies

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-2.js)

The callback we're passing to `React.useEffect` is called after _every_ render
of our component (including re-renders). This is exactly what we want because we
want to make sure that the `name` is saved into localStorage whenever it
changes, but there are various reasons a component can be re-rendered (for
example, when a parent component in the application tree gets re-rendered).

Really, we _only_ want localStorage to get updated when the `name` state
actually changes. It doesn't need to re-run any other time. Luckily for us,
`React.useEffect` allows you to pass a second argument called the "dependency
array" which signals to React that your effect callback function should be
called when (and only when) those dependencies change. So we can use this to
avoid doing unnecessary work!

Add a dependencies array for `React.useEffect` to avoid the callback being
called too frequently.

### 3. 💯 custom hook

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-3.js)

The best part of hooks is that if you find a bit of logic inside your component
function that you think would be useful elsewhere, you can put that in another
function and call it from the components that need it (just like regular
JavaScript). These functions you create are called "custom hooks".

Create a custom hook called `useLocalStorageState` for reusability of all this
logic.

### 4. 💯 flexible localStorage hook

[Production deploy](https://react-hooks.netlify.app/isolated/final/02.extra-4.js)

Take your custom `useLocalStorageState` hook and make it generic enough to
support any data type (remember, you have to serialize objects to strings... use
`JSON.stringify` and `JSON.parse`). Go wild with this!

## Notes

If you'd like to learn more about when different hooks are called and the order
in which they're called, then open up `src/examples/hook-flow.png` and
`src/examples/hook-flow.js`. Play around with that a bit and hopefully that will
help solidify this for you. Note that understanding this isn't absolutely
necessary for you to understand hooks, but it _will_ help you in some situations
so it's useful to understand.
