/*  SH Notes:

    RE: Wrapper

      Update:
      I guess wrapper is not necessary.
      I guess the fetchPokemon() call *IS* the wrapped function?
      It is the only level of wrapping that we need?
      Only need an additional layer of wrapping if using asynch await.

          React.useEffect(() => {
            async function effect() {
              const result = await doSomeAsyncThing()
              // do something with the result
            }
            effect()
          })

      For Promises, this works:

          React.useEffect(() => {
            doSomeAsyncThing().then(result => {
              // do something with the result
            })
          })

		  Their solution does not use a wrapper. Why?
      I am using a wrapper because the return value for useEffect is supposed
      to be the cleanup function.
      Solution did NOT use a wrapper, and also did not use a catch
      :-((  Did I do unnecessary work. Make it too complicated?

      If not wrapped, this is what *I* think would happen:
      1) the early return sets an empty cleanup function.
        while this is what we want in this case, it is being accidentally set
        to that value for the wrong reasons. A code change could produce errors.
        The code is misleading.
      2) Hmm. Doesn't a promise always have a return value?
        I might be wrong on this, or misunderstand. But is not an implicit
        `.then()` part of this? I need to re-read promises and asynch/await
        to be sure. Anyway, if so, then that is also being set as a returned
        cleanup value in the case of a successful fetch.
        Maybe it is only asynch/await that causes this type of issue?
        Or perhaps I misunderstand altogether, and there is no issue at all.

    RE: Why set pokemon null before fetch
      SH: Setting pokemon to null clears previous result and
      re-renders image to show loading screen until response is received.
      If fetch fails, well, the loading screen remains
      If fetch is successful, setState updates and re-renders with new pokemon.
