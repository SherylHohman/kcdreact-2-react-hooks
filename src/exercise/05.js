// useRef and useEffect: DOM interaction

// SH Notes: Here are links to the library docs and usage examples.
//  Sure, Kent *gives us* the code necessary to implement this library.
//  But it is better for my understanding, to not look at that, and instead
//  try to figure out both how to use the library, and how to convert that into
//  how to use the library for React by myself, and at the same time.
//  Otherwise, I get no sense at what part is React related, or even what I did
//  at all, besides copy-paste!
//  Example usage: https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/

function Tilt({children}) {
  // 🐨 create a ref here with React.useRef()

  //  each re-render creates a new ref. As the DOM changes, the React ref for
  //  the node changes. (In a way, I said that inside out, or backwards.
  //  but depending on one's point view, it can make more sense to speak as though
  //  coming from that point of view from the DOM instead of from React)

  // UPDATE:
  // SO.. I *think* this component never "re-renders"
  // I think in this case, the library directly controlls
  //  this DOM node, and react does not touch it after initial render, unless it is to be removed.
  //  The library manipulates the node, its events, and visuals
  // So the Ref does not change.
  // ...or even if React were to re-render it, the Ref used by the
  //  library does not change, because we gave it an [] empty dependancy array!

  // But because the Ref does not actually ever change, I *think*
  //  I am not sure we actually *need* to give it an *[]* empty dependancy array.
  //  Seems [vanillaTiltRef] would work just the same.
  // It seems that *in this case, as is* even leaving the param off
  //  would probalby work just the same, because the element never re-renders (?)
  //  BUT I would *not* suggest doing that! JIC

  const vanillaTiltRef = React.useRef()
  // NOTE: we are initializing the ref with 'undefined': notice we are not
  //        passing in any value.
  //       While we created a VARIABLE that represents a REF Object,
  //        its (custom? properties/property values ?) have not yet been set.
  //        Specifically, theRef.current is === `undefined`
  //
  //        Once we RENDER the element (rem: we pass it in as a `ref` prop)
  //        the React element is *created* and assigned.
  //        THEN React re-renders, and has a value assigned.
  //        So then, inside useEffect, its `current` *does* have a value
  //       ...
  //       However... React *is* able to get a `current` value by the time our
  //        useEffect runs! (kind of by definition!!)

  //  NOTE: useRef
  //    Is used when we do NOT want to trigger a REACT RE-RENDER
  //      (If we *do* want to trigger a re-render, use useState instead)
  //    More info:
  //      useRef.current changes on re-render
  //      useRef itself does not. It is created when the component is mounted
  //        but the ref Object reference does NOT change.
  //        it IS MUTATED, though. its CURRENT PROPERTY DOES change during re-render
  //        The current property is always updated to point to the current render
  //        (while the cleanup function holds a pointer to the previous render
  //          which is of course run before the next useEffect is run, and is
  //          yada, yada, destruction... yada.)
  //      useRef hook is used for more than just DOM nodes.
  //        (again, see first line of this note)
  //        useRef creates an object... and its `current` property is MUTABLE.
  //        Anytime you want to maintain a reference to something
  //        And anytime you want to make changes to that thing
  //        ...without triggering a re-render.

    //  are NOT tracking or updating the cursor coordinates. We are only deciding

    // The set of effects we want to use do not change.

          and then again when it is dismounted, but never on re-render (empty
          dependency array)
        So the only thing we need it to do, is delete the eventHandlers when the
            component dismounts.
            Vanilla-Tilt docs (https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-tilt)

         Destroy instance
         Delete the "old" React reference, the old library connection to the DOM

  ----- How to read docs, and translate how to apply plain JS instructions
        to a React codebase.
        When they want a DOM element (they get via document.querySelector)
        We just substitute in our instance of useRefVariable.current in its place.
        And otherwise follow the instructions for using plain JS
        (rather than the html version?)

  So, from the examples file (linked to in the README.md docs): https://micku7zu.github.io/vanilla-tilt.js/

  How to use:
    <div class="your-element" data-tilt></div>
  ie, add `data-tilt` to the element, (and also have to add the vanilla-tilt script to the end of the file)

  Then it shows that if you want to add OPTIONS, do it this way:
    <div class="your-element" data-tilt data-tilt-max="50" data-tilt-speed="400" data-tilt-perspective="500"></div>
  ie, list vanilla-tilt options as (attributes - "properties") on the html element.

  Finally, it show the plain "JS Way" it to do:
    VanillaTilt.init(document.querySelector(".your-element"), {
      max: 25,
      speed: 400
    });

  NOTICE THAT document.querySelector(<classname>) IS A HANDLE ON THE DOM "node"/ELEMENT
    IN OUR CASE, REACT REF (from useRef and useEffect ourRef.current)
    IS OUR HANDLE. We do not use a classname (which is JS way of FINDING the DOM node)
    We use the REF we created.
  So (below) instead of "elementName", we are giving it our REF (useRefInstance.current).current

  Compare this to The way we use React.createElement to create JSX
    React.createElement(elementName, properties, children)
  OR in the format
    React.createElement(elementName, {children, ...properties})

  Extrapolating the plain JS Way and React.createElement 2nd format, we get:
    React.createElement(elementName, { <vanilla-tilt options as key value pairs>})
  AND noting that elementName in our case is our REF (vanillaTiltRef.current)
  we get the following:
    React.createElement(vanillaTiltRef.current, { <options> })

  And translating that back to JSX we have:
    <div ref=vanillaTiltRef {<vanilla tilt options>} className="className" miscOtherProperties>
    {children}</div>

  SOOOoooo: now we get at the example code they provide:
    <div...

    VanillaTilt.init(tiltNode, {
  //   max: 25,
  //   speed: 400,
  //   glare: true,
  //   'max-glare': 0.5,
  // })
  // where tiltNode = vanillaTiltRef.current

  -----

  More notes on how I think about how to translate library usage
		instructions from vanilla JS usage and DOM access (via document.querySelector)
		to how to use it with React and a useRef variable (myUseRefVar.current)
	As well as how to interpret the usage "docs"/examples in general
	The comments are very raw, and many are incorrect. It is my live
		thought processes, trying to figure it out, with as little "peeking"
		at the exercise coding hints as possible.

  One point I need to pay attention to is that there are 2 very different
		parts to the usage. One is the HTML (in my case JSX) element.
		And the other part is the JS script that is needed to "activate"
		or attach the library script to that HTML (JSX) element, including
		the preferred tilt options we want it to run with.

  This is the part I was just beginning to see as I stopped for the
		night. Originally, I thought it was one or the other ( I know... duh)
		So, this library is a script that gets attached to an element.
		The other part is the API to attach their script to the element,
		AND set some configurable options for how their script will run.
		Their script will takes care of the event listeners, the cursor, and
		TRANSFORMING the element (warping the graphic, colors, etc).

  It turns out that the biggest hurdle of this library might have been in
    understanding what it is actually doing, and the basics of how it works. Now
		that I think I understand (am developing an understanding of) the library
		itself, in terms of its vanilla JS implementation, it seems the React
    portion may be fairly easy and straight forward.
    - A useRef.current variable simply replaces the
		  `document.QuerySelector(".classname"-"id"-or-whatever)`.
    - a function call `VanillaTilt.init()` attaches their script to a DOM
      element that is passed into this function call.
    - optionally, a set of custom options can also be passed into this `init`
      function as a second argument, in the form of an object.
    - their script attaches an event handler to the given DOM element.
      As such, we need to remove the event handler when it is no longer relevant
      `VanillaTilt.destroy()` removes the event handler.
      It is to be called if: 1) we no longer want vanilla-tilt to control
      (produce side effects, manipulate the graphical display) of the element,
      or 2) we remove the element from the DOM.
      Its parameter is the same as the (1st argument) of the init function:
      a DOM reference.
      In our case, that is our `useRefVariable.current` or in vanillaJS, the
      document.querySelector(".classname"-"id"-or-whatever).

      ----

      OK, made a couple PR's to Vanilla Tilt that got merged!
       -(typos on main branch README.md)
       - typos on gh-pages branch: Examples page, and README.md (same as on main)

       And finally, I think I understtand BOTH vanilla tilt AND how to use it
        with React. create a useEffect, that is called only once (so an EMPTY []
          dependency array) to call its initialization the script
          (`vanillaTilt.init`), which attaches the script to the DOM node (REF)
          we give it, and sets the options we (optionally) can pass in as well.
            ie: `vanillaTilt.init(myRef.current, optionsObject)`
          useEffect also sets the cleanup function `vanillaTilt.destroy()`
            ie: `vanillaTilt.destroy(myRef.current)

      Note that the inner elements (children elements to the vanilla-tilt "root"
        element) are used for the parallax effect option, and is acheived by
        through the `transform` and `transform-style` settings.
